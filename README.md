# Notes for 18.6501x - Fundamentals of Statistics

I'm going to be uploading all of my notes here in the form of jupyter notebooks. Don't worry if you don't have python or jupyter installed - github will render the pages for you!

Hope this helps us all understand things a little better

edit 8/24/2022: I apologize that my notes only cover half of the class, but I'm happy so many people have found them useful!
